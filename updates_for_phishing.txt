Play around with Pappa's streamlit code and see what each part does (header, sidebar, etc.) and make the phishing streamlit look nicer

Make 3 buttons for each model so the user has the choice to choose which model they want to run their dataset with

Display the accuracy, confusion matrix of each model eventually

Change name of directory from pappa's code and make sure feature list is the same. Make sure folder is correct as well.
